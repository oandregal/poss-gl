"programming talent. A great programmer with lousy communications skills can "
"get only one thing done at a time, and even then may have trouble convincing "

"that free software development environments are bewilderingly diverse both "

"expressed in a post to the mailing list, as an annotation in the bug "

"Don't fall into the trap of writing everything as though it were a cell "

"of each sentence, and use paragraph breaks where needed. This is most "
"important in emails and other composed writings. In IRC or similarly "

"Construct the subject lines of new mails carefully. It's the most important "
"line in your mail, because it allows each other person in the project to "
"decide whether or not to read more. Modern mail reading software organizes "
"groups of related messages into threads, which can be defined not only by a "
"common subject, but by various other headers (which are sometimes not "
"displayed). It follows that if a thread starts to drift to a new topic, you "
"can&mdash;and should&mdash;adjust the subject line accordingly when "
"replying. The thread's integrity will be preserved, due to those other "
"headers, but the new subject will help people looking at an overview of the "
"thread know that the topic has drifted. Likewise, if you really want to "
"start a new topic, do it by posting a fresh mail, not by replying to an "
"existing mail and changing the subject. Otherwise, your mail would still be "
"grouped in to the same thread as what you're replying to, and thus fool "
"people into thinking it's about something it's not. Again, the penalty would "
"not only be the waste of their time, but the slight dent in your credibility "
